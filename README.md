# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-ND-Term1
The focus of Term 1 is applying machine learning to automotive tasks: deep learning, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and computer vision. It includes 5 projects from the Udacity SDC-ND Term 1 curriculum. 

GitHub repository links to Term 1 projects are as given below.
